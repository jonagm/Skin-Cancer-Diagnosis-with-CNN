### Overview
The objective of this project is to implement a model that utilizes a "simple" architecture capable of achieving results comparable to those of more complex architectures through Model Distillation or Knowledge Distillation. This approach enables the classification of RGB images of benign moles and skin cancer, effectively identifying both the type of cancer and the type of mole.

### Purpose
This implementation aims to leverage the potential of increasingly complex and large models by distilling their knowledge into a smaller model. This will contribute to advancing the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine.

### Repository Contents
This repository includes all the necessary code to train, evaluate, and test a deep learning model for skin cancer classification. Users only need to provide the training data, which can be guided by the datasets I have created and used.
